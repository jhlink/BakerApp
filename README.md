## App Development in Reflection
This app has been such an experience. 
- Should have started with Dagger2 from the onset. This would have made testing a lot easier. 
- Should have organized by feature
- Should have started with UnitTests from the onset. Would have saved the trouble of debugging weird network errors and such.  
- Using ViewModels and Repository have been very helpful, however still need to figure out someway to test both. 
- Should invest more time in managing data state between Room and the network within Repository.  
- Utilize build variants to separate debug and release packages
